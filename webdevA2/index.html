          <h3>Why Adoption and Rescue are Important</h3>
          <p>Adopting a cat from a shelter or rescue organization is a compassionate and responsible choice. Here are some reasons why adoption and rescue are important:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Saving Lives:</strong> By adopting a cat, you provide a loving home to an animal in need. Many cats in shelters are looking for a second chance at a happy life.</li>
            <li><strong>Reducing Overpopulation:</strong> Adoption helps to address the issue of cat overpopulation. By choosing adoption, you actively contribute to reducing the number of stray and homeless cats.</li>
            <li><strong>Supporting Ethical Practices:</strong> Reputable shelters and rescue organizations prioritize the welfare of animals. When you adopt, you support organizations that work to ensure the well-being of cats and promote responsible pet ownership.</li>
            <li><strong>Health and Behavior:</strong> Cats available for adoption are often spayed or neutered, vaccinated, and given necessary medical care. Additionally, shelters and rescues provide valuable insights into a cat's behavior and temperament, helping you find a cat that fits your lifestyle.</li>
